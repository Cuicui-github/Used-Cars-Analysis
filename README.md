# Used-Cars-Analysis
## Introduction
People always wonder how to evaluate a used car, so they can buy or sell a used car at an ideal price. This analysis will give some ideas about the questions people may have. I selected a sample data with 25430 observations including 13 variables from craigslist US. I filtered the sample from the original data based on the following conditions: Price from 500 to 50000, year from 2010 to 2019 (I used age in the analysis instead), cylinders including 4, 6 and 8, odometer from 0 to 100000, fuel type is gas. After basic analysis of data, I focused on the analysis of price change from 3 to 9 years using Sedan and SUV with 4 cylinders as example. I used median price instead of mean in the analysis since the price was skewed. 9 popular manufacturers from three countries been considered in the following findings which are DE: Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz (taken as luxury cars); JP: Honda, Nissan, Toyota; US: Chevrolet, Dodge, Ford.
